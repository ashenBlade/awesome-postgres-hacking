## Core

### Blogs

* [Posting Your Patch On pgsql-hackers](https://rhaas.blogspot.com/2024/08/posting-your-patch-on-pgsql-hackers.html) - Robert Haas

### Books

* [The Internals of PostgreSQL](https://www.interdb.jp/pg/index.html) - Hironobu SUZUKI - The main purposes of this document are to explain how each subsystem works, and to provide the whole picture of PostgreSQL.
* [PostgreSQL 14 Internals](https://edu.postgrespro.com/postgresql_internals-14_en.pdf) - Egor Rogov - This book is for those who will not settle for a black-box approach when working with a database. 

### [Mailing Lists](https://www.postgresql.org/list/)

* [pgsql-hackers](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-hackers/) - The PostgreSQL developers team lives here. Discussion of current development issues, problems and bugs, and proposed new features. If your question cannot be answered by people in the other lists, and it is likely that only a developer will know the answer, you may re-post your question in this list. You must try elsewhere first!
* [pgsql-committers](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-committers/) - Notification of git commits are sent to this list. Do not post here!
* [pgsql-bugs](https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-bugs/) - If you find a bug, please use the [bug reporting form](http://www.postgresql.org/support/submitbug).
* [Understanding the Postgres Hackers Mailing List Language](https://www.crunchydata.com/blog/understanding-the-postgres-hackers-mailing-list) - Greg Sabino Mullane
